										<h2>Tesco food Love Stories</h2>

									<p>Tesco’s Food Love Stories Ramadan ad saw one of the biggest uplifts along the diversity segment of British Asians we showed it to.
										We talked to George Rivers and Nick Ashley from Tesco to get an insight into the ad, the campaign, 
										and how one of Britain’s biggest brands handles the issues raised in this report.
										<p>
											Food Love Stories has been running for four and a half years, and the Ramadan campaign with the
											three brothers was envisaged and born during the first lockdown of 2020. Tesco had just run an Easter
											Food Love Story about a couple enjoying a more romantic Easter Sunday, which they’d edited to be contextually
											more relevant to lockdown.The team was looking at what other moments were likely to be different to how we all expected,
											and how people would still be connecting during the lockdown.Tesco’s research showed that the Muslim community were going
											to be affected by the impossibility of getting together during Ramadan, with one imam describing the potential proceedings as
											“emotionally challenging, frustrating and culturally alien”.
										</p>Ramadan is a religious moment where people come together with their 
										family and enjoy food together, and Tesco felt it really captured the heart of Food Love Stories – about making the food you love 
										for the people you love.It would show the power of food to bring people together.</p>
										<p>As well, Tesco had millions of customers and thousands of colleagues observing Ramadan – the team wanted to show they understood
											 what those people were going through and that Tesco could help them.Tesco shot the spot with actual brothers and their 
											 real aunt – the shoot took 3 weeks from start to finish.The brothers helped with lots of input on authentic dialogue and ad libs, 
											 which helps explain why the ad was so recognisable and well received by the British Asian sample we showed it to – but also why it 
											 felt warm and natural to the general population too.The ad fits into a general commitment to inclusion and authenticity.75 % of the 
											 UK population visit Tesco at least once every 12 weeks, so representation is crucial. Tesco represents Britain’s everyday 
											 shoppers – whoever they are and whatever they eat.It aims to serve as much of the population as possible.So Food Love Stories consciously 
											 focuses on individual, authentic stories – the team talks about “resonance not reach”, as individual ads are only part of the wider patchwork 
											 of the campaign.To make sure they achieve this resonance, Tesco set up a BAME committee who are consulted on all their ads throughout the 
											 process – offering input on scripts, costumes and ingredients.As this report makes clear, a strategy like this only works when a team aims 
											 to make great ads, not just inclusive ones.For the Tesco team, that means always making sure there’s a universal human truth at the heart of 
											 the work, which can be seen through the different lenses of diversity and inclusion.In the case of Food Love Stories, that emotional core is 
											 making the food you love for the people you love – something everyone can relate to, albeit in many different ways.</p>
